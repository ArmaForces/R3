# Arma 3 After Action Replay *Addon* Component

Server Side addon for capturing unit movement and behaviour to a database for After Action Replays on a website. 

### WIP

This is a heavy work in progress, don't expect anything to work at this stage.

Being built along side the [web component](https://github.com/alexcroox/R3-Web).

### Special thanks

ACE3 dev team for providing [coding guidelines](http://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/coding-guidelines.html) and the [project template](https://github.com/acemod/arma-project-template) this was created from.

[NRF1] Crazy for working with me on the original AAR as part of the old 5th Rifles mission framework. Much of his original SQF inspired this dedicated addon.
